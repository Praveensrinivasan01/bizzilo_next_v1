                  <h3>Utilization of Automation and Artificial Intelligence:</h3>

                  <p>To enhance productivity and predictive capabilities for our users, we utilize various technologies, including regex parsing, template matching, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. To uphold our commitment to respecting your privacy and confidentiality expectations, we only make limited use of service data for these technologies.

Our automation and artificial intelligence technologies primarily rely on our organization's data, such as internal communications, interactions with customers, internal documents, and information from free and paid external sources.</p>

                  <h3>Handling Do Not Track (DNT) Requests:</h3>

                  <p>Some internet browsers feature 'Do Not Track' (DNT) capabilities, which send a signal (DNT signal) to websites visited, indicating a user's preference not to be tracked. Currently, there is no standard governing how websites should respond to these signals. Therefore, we do not take specific action in response to DNT signals at this time.</p>
